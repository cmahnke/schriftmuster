Since I was heavily involved in the field of [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (OCR) a few years ago, I also have a fairly extensive collection of font samples. Since I am no longer working on that topic, I would like to offer this collection as a resource for further developments. Many of the patterns shown are now also available elsewhere on the Internet, sometimes even as font files.

It's the purpose of this blog to provide high-quality digital copies for [further processing](/reuse/). Therefore, all content is provided under a Creative Commons license (attribution - sharing alike).

# Colophon

This page was generated with [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io/).

 An adapted version of [Nederburg] (https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-theme) is used as the theme. [Raleway] (https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/) is used as the font.

The post-processing of the digitized images was carried out with [ScanTailor Advanced] (https://github.com/4lex4/scantailor-advanced).

[OpenLayers] (https://openlayers.org/) is used to display the high resolution images. The tiles were generated with [`iiif_static.py`] (https://github.com/zimeon/iiif).

The site is hosted by [GitHub] (https://github.com/).
